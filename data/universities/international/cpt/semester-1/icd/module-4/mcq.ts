PRE OP DIAGNOSIS: Left Breast Abnormal MMX or Palpable Mass; Other Disorders Of Breast PROCEDURE: Automated Stereotactic Biopsy Left Breast FINDINGS: Lesion is located in the lateral region, just at or below the level of the nipple on the 90 degree lateral view. There is a subglandular implant in place. I discussed the procedure with the patient today including risks, benefits and alternatives. Specifically discussed was the fact that the implant would be displaced out of the way during this biopsy procedure. Possibility of injury to the implant was discussed with the patient. Patient has signed the consent form and wishes to proceed with the biopsy. The patient was placed prone on the stereotactic table; the left breast was then imaged from the inferior approach. The lesion of interest is in the anterior portion of the breast away from the implant which was displaced back toward the chest wall. After imaging was obtained and stereotactic guidance used to target coordinates for the biopsy, the left breast was prepped with Betadine. 1% lidocaine was injected subcutaneously for local anesthetic. Additional lidocaine with epinephrine was then injected through the indwelling needle. The SenoRx needle was then placed into the area of interest. Under stereotactic guidance we obtained 9 core biopsy samples using vacuum and cutting technique. The specimen radiograph confirmed representative sample of calcification was removed. The tissue marking clip was deployed into the biopsy cavity successfully. This was confirmed by final stereotactic digital image and confirmed by post core biopsy mammogram left breast. The clip is visualized projecting over the lateral anterior left breast in satisfactory position. No obvious calcium is visible on the final post core biopsy image in the area of interest. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no apparent complications. The biopsy site was dressed with Steri-Strips, bandage and ice pack in the usual manner. The patient did receive written and verbal post-biopsy instructions. The patient left our department in good condition. IMPRESSION: 1.

P., M.D\n\nANESTHESIA: Monitored anesthesia care with local anesthetic\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Left chest wall mass\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Left chest wall mass\nNAME OF OPERATION: Left chest wall mass excision\nINDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: Mr. C is a 63-year-old gentleman who presented to the outpatient clinic with a palpable left chest wall mass. Clinical characteristics suggested a benign lipoma. However, because of the very large size of the mass and the fact that it had increased in size rapidly I recommended a complete excision for definitive diagnosis. He presents today for that purpose.\nOPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient had a left chest wall mass excised without difficulty. The mass measured approximately 7 centimeters and had the benign appearance of a lipoma.\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Mr. C was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. Because this was a sedation case, no sequential compression devices were applied. However, a single dose of Ancef 1 gram was administered intravenously 10 minutes prior to the incision time. Sedation was then initiated with propofol and Fentanyl and the patient was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion. The left chest wall mass was palpated and an incision directly over it along the Langer's line was planned. This was infiltrated with a mixture of 1 percent plain lidocaine and 0.5 percent plain Marcaine. The incision was then made and carried down through the dermis with electrocautery. We then opened the subcutaneous tissue of the skin and immediately encountered an organized mass that has a benign appearance of a lipoma. Using careful blunt and sharp dissection, we were able to completely excise this mass around its entire circumference leaving the capsule intact. Once we had the mass largely excised from the anterior, superior, inferior, lateral, and medial approaches the mass was everted from the chest wall. The mass was then removed from its posterior attachments using electrocautery. The mass was then passed off the field. Attention was then turned to the wound. Aggressive hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery. The wound was irrigated with copious amounts of sterile saline. A deep 3-0 Vicryl stitch was then placed to reapproximate the pectoralis fascia. The deep dermal layer was then reapproximated with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl stitches. The skin was reapproximated with a running subcuticular using 4-0 Monocryl. Dermabond dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well, was awakened, and transferred to the recovery room.\nThe specimens removed include the left chest wall mass, which measured 7 centimeters. Estimated blood loss was minimal. Intravenous fluids were 700 milliliters of crystalloid. Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. The condition of the patient on discharge from the operating room was stable.\nSPECIMENS REMOVED: Left chest wall mass measuring 7 cm\nWhat is the correct CPT® code?",
