    "question": "1. Julie, a 28-year-old ESRD patient was seen by Dr. Jeri in an outpatient hospital facility for treatment of an obstructed hemodialysis AV graft. Dr. Jeri provided moderate conscious sedation to Julie for percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty of the venous portion of the graft. This procedure lasted 45 minutes. Julie had an excellent result and was released to home after recovery from the treatment. Dr. Jeri performed the professional radiological supervision and interpretation with this procedure.

A carotid CT angiogram showed a recurrent 90% left internal carotid artery stenosis extending into the common carotid artery. He is taken to the operating room for re-do left carotid endarterectomy. The left neck was prepped and the previous incision was carefully reopened. Using sharp dissection, the common carotid artery and its branches were dissected free. The patient was systematically heparinized and after a few minutes clamps applied to the common carotid artery and its branches. A longitudinal arteriotomy was carried out with findings of extensive layering of intimal hyperplasia with no evidence of recurrent atherosclerosis. A silastic balloon-tip shunt was inserted first proximally and then distally, with restoration of flow.

    "question": "16. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left breast carcinoma. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left breast carcinoma. NAME OF PROCEDURE: Left lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient is a 65-year female admitted with a diagnosis of left breast carcinoma. Risks and benefits of the procedure had been discussed preoperatively including risks of bleeding, infection, deformity in the breast, chronic pain, numbness, chronic lymph edema associated with the lymph node biopsy as well as other possible complications. The patient agreed to proceed. Because the wire was located in the upper outer quadrant of the breast over the lesion and the length of the wire was 10 cm, it was felt that it would be best to approach the node biopsy as well as the lumpectomy through the same incision in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. Incision was made with a 15-blade through skin and subcutaneous. Homeostasis achieved with Bovie electrocautery. Flaps were formed in the usual manner. A wire was brought out through the incision. We then circumferentially removed all the tissue around the wire down to the tip. We marked the specimen with a long lateral stitch, short superior stitch, 2 lateral clips, and 1 superior clip. We were able to identify a hot node in the axilla and at least 2 lymph nodes that were blue-dyed within the sentinel nodes. We did perform lymphoscintigraphy and injected 2 cc of methylene blue dye in the periareolar area preoperatively and massaged the breast for 5 minutes. The lymph nodes were excised and a biopsy was performed on the axillary node. At this point, we copiously irrigated the area to assure good homeostasis. We placed clips throughout the entire cavity. We then closed the deep dermal tissue with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures and then closed the skin with a fine 5-0 nylon. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Sponge count was correct. Blood loss was minimal. The patient was sent to the recovery room in stable condition. What are the codes for these procedures?",

    "question": "23. Procedure: Dual chamber pacemaker defibrillator implantation. Indications: A 67-year-old white gentleman who has significant underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF of 25 percent, prior infarcts, remote history of syncope and at high risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmias. He has had a recent T wave alternans test which was clearly abnormal. He has had episodes of resting bradycardia also noted. He also meets Madit II criteria for ICD implantation. Description of Procedure: After informed consent had been obtained, the patient was brought to the outpatient hospital lab in the fasting state. The left anterior chest was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. Intravenous sedation and local anesthetic were given. After local anesthetic, a 5 cm incision was made at the left deltopectoral groove. With blunt dissection and cautery, this was carried down through the prepectoralis fascia. The cephalic vein was identified and ligated distally. Through the venotomy, a subclavian venogram was performed to provide a roadmap. The atrial and ventricular leads were then advanced into the vessel to the level of the right atrium under fluoroscopic guidance. The ventricular lead was maneuvered to the right ventricular outflow tract and then through the RV apex where it was actively fixed. Good sensing and pacing thresholds were demonstrated. The lead was anchored to the pre-pectoralis fascia with interrupted 2-0 Tycron sutures. 10 volt pacing did not result in diaphragmatic capture. The atrial lead was maneuvered to the anterolateral right atrial wall where it was actively fixed. Good sensing and pacing thresholds were demonstrated. The lead was anchored to the pre-pectoralis fascia with interrupted 2-0 Tycron sutures. 10 volt pacing did not result in diaphragmatic capture. A subcutaneous pocket was created with good hemostasis achieved. The pocket was subsequently irrigated with solution of Bacitracin. The generator was connected to the lead and then placed in the pocket with no tension on the lead. The deep fascial layer was closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl suture. The subcutaneous closure was made with running 3-0 Vicryl suture. Subcuticular closure was made with running 4-0 Vicryl suture. Steri-strips were applied. Ventricular fibrillation was induced with a T wave shock. This was successfully sensed and terminated with a 15 joule shock to sinus rhythm. High voltage impedence was 39 ohms. Dry dressing was placed over the wound. The patient returned to the floor in stable condition without apparent complications.

    "explanation": "Defibrillator is the first hint in finding this procedure code. The only codes that have “defibrillator” in their code description are 33240 and 33249. Code 33249 is the correct code since electrical leads were inserted for a dual chamber pacemaker defibrillator in connecting it to a generator. Code 71090 is coded to report the fluoroscopic guidance to place the leads.

    "question": "29. A 62-year old female with three-vessel disease and supraventricular tachycardia, which has been refractory to other management. She previously had pacemaker placement and stenting of the coronary artery stenosis, which has failed to solve the problem. She will undergo CABG with autologous saphenous vein and a modified MAZE procedure to treat the tachycardia. The risks and benefits have been discussed and the patient wishes to proceed. She is brought to the cardiac OR and placed supine on the OR table. She is prepped and draped and adequate endotracheal anesthesia is assured. A median sternotomy incision is made and cardiopulmonary bypass is initiated. The endoscope is used to harvest an adequate length of saphenous vein from her left leg. This is uneventful and bleeding is easily controlled. The vein graft is prepared and cut to the appropriate lengths for anatomosis. Three bypasses are performed, one to the LAD, one to the circumflex and another distally on the circumflex. A modified maze procedure was then performed and the patient was weaned from bypass. Once the heart was once again beating on its own again, we attempted to induce an arrhythmia and this could not be done.

An artery was anastomosed to the left subclavian artery and brought down to the left anterior descending and anastomosed into place. The aortic cross-clamp was removed after 55 minutes with spontaneous cardioversion to a normal sinus rhythm. The patient was warmed and weaned from the bypass without difficulties after 104 minutes.
