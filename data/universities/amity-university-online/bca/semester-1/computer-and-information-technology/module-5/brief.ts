    "question": "What is an algorithm?",
    "answer": "An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a task. It consists of a sequence of well-defined instructions that lead to a desired outcome."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key features of object-oriented programming (OOP)?",
    "answer": "The key features of OOP are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. These principles help in creating modular, reusable, and maintainable code."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of using pseudocode in programming?",
    "answer": "Pseudocode is used to design algorithms in a human-readable format before writing actual code. It helps programmers focus on logic without worrying about syntax."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the different types of control structures in programming?",
    "answer": "The three main control structures are sequence (executing statements in order), selection (decision-making using if-else and switch), and iteration (loops such as for, while, do-while)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are flowcharts important in programming?",
    "answer": "Flowcharts provide a visual representation of an algorithm or process, making it easier to understand, debug, and communicate logic among team members."
