  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of using hexadecimal numbers in computing?",
    "answer": "Hexadecimal numbers (base 16) provide a compact and readable representation of binary data, simplifying memory addresses and color codes."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the significance of One’s and Two’s complement?",
    "answer": "One's complement flips all bits of a binary number, while Two's complement adds 1 to the one's complement, simplifying arithmetic operations."

  {
    "question": "What is De Morgan's theorem in Boolean algebra?",
    "answer": "De Morgan's theorem states that the complement of a sum equals the product of complements, and the complement of a product equals the sum of complements."
