    "question": "**What are the different types of computer memory?**",
    "questionRead": "",
    "answer": "**Computer memory is classified into:** \n- **Primary Memory (RAM/ROM):** Stores data temporarily for quick access. RAM is volatile, while ROM is non-volatile. \n- **Secondary Storage:** Long-term storage like hard drives and SSDs. \n- **Cache Memory:** High-speed memory that stores frequently accessed data. \n- **Registers:** Small storage locations inside the CPU for immediate data processing."

    "question": "**What are the main generations of computers?**",
    "questionRead": "",
    "answer": "**Computers have evolved over five generations:** \n- **First Generation (1940s-50s):** Used vacuum tubes, large size, slow processing. \n- **Second Generation (1950s-60s):** Used transistors, smaller and faster. \n- **Third Generation (1960s-70s):** Used integrated circuits (ICs). \n- **Fourth Generation (1970s-present):** Microprocessors and personal computers. \n- **Fifth Generation (Present-Future):** Artificial intelligence and advanced processing."

    "question": "**What is the difference between hardware and software?**",
    "questionRead": "",
    "answer": "**Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system, such as the CPU, memory, and peripherals. Software refers to the programs and operating systems that run on the hardware, allowing users to perform tasks and manage resources. Without software, hardware is non-functional, and without hardware, software cannot operate.**"
