    "question": "What is the importance of measures of central tendency in data analysis?",
    "questionRead": "",
    "answer": "Measures of central tendency, including mean, median, and mode, provide a central value for a dataset, summarizing it with a single representative number. They help simplify complex data and make it easier to analyze and compare. The mean offers an overall view, the median is useful for skewed data, and the mode identifies the most frequent value.",

    "question": "What is the difference between range and standard deviation?",
    "questionRead": "",
    "answer": "Range is the difference between the largest and smallest values and provides a simple measure of spread. Standard deviation, however, measures how much values deviate from the mean and considers all data points. Unlike range, standard deviation provides a more comprehensive view of data variability and is less influenced by outliers.",

    "question": "How is skewness calculated and what does it indicate?",
    "questionRead": "",
    "answer": "Skewness measures the asymmetry of a data distribution. It is calculated using the formula: Skewness = 3(Mean - Median)/Standard Deviation. Positive skewness indicates a longer right tail, while negative skewness indicates a longer left tail. A skewness of 0 suggests a symmetric distribution.",

    "question": "What are quartiles and how do they divide the data?",
    "questionRead": "",
    "answer": "Quartiles divide data into four equal parts: Q1 (25th percentile), Q2 (50th percentile or median), and Q3 (75th percentile). They help understand data distribution and identify outliers. The interquartile range (IQR), calculated as Q3 - Q1, measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data.",

    "question": "What is kurtosis and how is it used in data analysis?",
    "questionRead": "",
    "answer": "Kurtosis measures the 'tailedness' of a distribution, indicating the presence of extreme values. High kurtosis suggests heavy tails with more outliers, while low kurtosis indicates lighter tails. It helps in assessing data risk and variability, useful in finance and quality control.",
