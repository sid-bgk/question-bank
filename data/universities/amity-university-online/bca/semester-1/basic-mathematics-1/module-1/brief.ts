    "question": "What is a universal set?",
    "answer": "A universal set is the set that contains all possible elements related to a particular discussion or problem. It is usually denoted by the symbol 'U' and serves as the reference set for all subsets under consideration."
  },
  {
    "question": "State and explain De Morgan's laws.",
    "answer": "De Morgan's laws describe the relationship between union and intersection of sets. They are: (1) The complement of the union of two sets is equal to the intersection of their complements: (A ∪ B)' = A' ∩ B'. (2) The complement of the intersection of two sets is equal to the union of their complements: (A ∩ B)' = A' ∪ B'."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between a finite and infinite set?",
    "answer": "A finite set is a set that contains a countable number of elements, meaning it has a specific, fixed size. For example, {1,2,3} is a finite set. An infinite set has an uncountable or limitless number of elements, such as the set of natural numbers N = {1,2,3,...}."

  {
    "question": "What are the types of matrices?",
    "answer": "Some common types of matrices include: (1) Row matrix - a matrix with only one row, (2) Column matrix - a matrix with only one column, (3) Square matrix - a matrix where the number of rows and columns are equal, (4) Diagonal matrix - a square matrix with non-zero elements only on the diagonal, (5) Identity matrix - a diagonal matrix with ones on the diagonal, (6) Zero matrix - a matrix with all elements equal to zero."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Cartesian product of two sets?",
    "answer": "The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where 'a' belongs to set A and 'b' belongs to set B. For example, if A = {1,2} and B = {x,y}, then A × B = {(1,x), (1,y), (2,x), (2,y)}."
