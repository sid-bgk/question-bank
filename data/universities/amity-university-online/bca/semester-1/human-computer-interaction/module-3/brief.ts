    "question": "What are the main goals of evaluation in HCI?",
    "answer": "The main goals of evaluation in HCI are to assess the system's functionality, evaluate the user experience, and identify specific usability issues. Evaluation helps ensure the system meets user needs and performs as expected."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is heuristic evaluation?",
    "answer": "Heuristic evaluation is an expert-based usability inspection method where evaluators review the interface against predefined usability principles (heuristics). It was developed by Jakob Nielsen and Rolf Molich and helps identify usability problems early in the design process."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does cognitive walkthrough differ from heuristic evaluation?",
    "answer": "Cognitive walkthrough focuses on evaluating a system’s learnability by simulating a user’s thought process when performing tasks. In contrast, heuristic evaluation relies on usability experts reviewing the interface against established usability guidelines to identify potential issues."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the advantages of field studies in evaluation?",
    "answer": "Field studies provide insights into how users interact with a system in their natural environment, offering realistic data on usability and behavior. They help identify real-world challenges that might not be evident in controlled settings like labs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the role of usability testing in system evaluation?",
    "answer": "Usability testing involves observing users as they interact with a system to identify usability issues, measure task efficiency, and assess user satisfaction. It helps designers understand how well users can complete tasks and identify areas for improvement."
