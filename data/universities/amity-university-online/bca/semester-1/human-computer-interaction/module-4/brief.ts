    "question": "What is a cognitive model, and how does it benefit HCI?",
    "answer": "A cognitive model represents human cognitive, perceptual, and motor processes to simulate user interactions with systems. It helps predict user behavior, improve interface design, and reduce cognitive load. Examples include GOMS and KLM models."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the different types of task analysis used in HCI?",
    "answer": "Task analysis includes task decomposition (breaking down tasks into subtasks), knowledge-based analysis (identifying necessary knowledge for tasks), and entity-relation-based analysis (analyzing objects and their relationships)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does hypertext differ from traditional text systems?",
    "answer": "Hypertext is a non-linear structure of linked documents, allowing users to navigate through hyperlinks, unlike traditional text systems, which follow a sequential order."
  },
  {
    "question": "What challenges are associated with ubiquitous computing?",
    "answer": "Challenges include privacy and security concerns, seamless integration of physical and virtual environments, power consumption, and ensuring consistent user experiences across devices."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the PIE model, and how does it contribute to HCI?",
    "answer": "The PIE (Predictability, Interaction, Execution) model focuses on user inputs and system outputs, improving usability by ensuring observability and predictability in system interactions."
