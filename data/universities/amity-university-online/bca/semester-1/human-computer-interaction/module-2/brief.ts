    "question": "What is the purpose of user-centered design in HCI?",
    "answer": "User-centered design focuses on designing interactive systems that prioritize user needs, goals, and feedback. It ensures that the final product is usable, accessible, and meets user expectations effectively."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key principles of heuristic evaluation?",
    "answer": "Key principles of heuristic evaluation include visibility of system status, user control and freedom, consistency and standards, error prevention, flexibility, and efficiency of use. These principles help identify usability issues in user interfaces."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the significance of prototyping in the design process?",
    "answer": "Prototyping is crucial in the design process as it allows designers to create a working model of the system to test functionality, gather user feedback, and identify potential issues before final implementation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is consistency important in user interface design?",
    "answer": "Consistency in UI design helps users predict system behavior, reduces cognitive load, and improves overall usability by maintaining uniformity in design elements such as layout, terminology, and navigation across the application."
  },
  {
    "question": "What role does iterative design play in software development?",
    "answer": "Iterative design allows for continuous refinement of the product through repeated cycles of prototyping, testing, and feedback. This approach enhances usability and ensures the final product meets user expectations efficiently."
