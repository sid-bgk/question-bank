    "question": "What is Interaction Design?",
    "answer": "**Interaction Design (IxD)** focuses on creating interfaces that facilitate user interaction with digital systems. It aims to make systems intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly by considering human behavior, usability principles, and technological constraints. The goal is to enhance user satisfaction by providing seamless interaction with software, websites, and devices."

    "question": "What are the key components of human cognitive function in HCI?",
    "answer": "The key components of human cognitive function in HCI include **Input/Output (I/O) Channels, Memory, and Reasoning & Problem-Solving.** I/O channels involve senses like vision, hearing, and touch for interacting with systems. Memory is categorized into sensory, short-term, and long-term memory for storing and processing information. Reasoning and problem-solving help users make decisions and achieve goals efficiently."

  {
    "question": "What are the primary types of computer memory in HCI?",
    "answer": "The primary types of computer memory are **RAM (Random Access Memory) and ROM (Read-Only Memory).** RAM is volatile memory that temporarily stores data needed for active processes, while ROM is non-volatile and permanently stores essential system data. Other storage devices include hard drives (for long-term storage) and cache memory (for faster access to frequently used data)."

  {
    "question": "What are different interaction styles in HCI?",
    "answer": "The different interaction styles in HCI include **Command-line interfaces (CLI), Menu-driven interfaces, Direct manipulation interfaces, Form-filling interfaces, and Natural language interfaces.** CLI requires users to type commands, while menu-driven interfaces provide options to select from. Direct manipulation allows users to interact directly with elements, and form-filling helps with structured data entry. Natural language interfaces use spoken or written input for interaction."

    "question": "What is the significance of ergonomics in HCI?",
    "answer": "Ergonomics in HCI ensures that systems are designed for **user comfort, efficiency, and safety.** It focuses on factors like screen placement, input device positioning, lighting conditions, and user posture to reduce physical strain and improve productivity. Good ergonomic design minimizes fatigue, enhances usability, and contributes to better user experiences."
