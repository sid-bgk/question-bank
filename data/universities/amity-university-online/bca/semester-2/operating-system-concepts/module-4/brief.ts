    "question": "Explain the key differences between the NTFS and FAT32 file systems, including their features and typical use cases.",
    "answer": "The **NTFS (New Technology File System)** and **FAT32 (File Allocation Table 32)** are two of the most widely used file systems developed by Microsoft, each with unique features and applications. NTFS, introduced with the Windows NT line, is the default file system for modern Windows systems (Windows 10, 8, 7, Vista, XP, 2000, and NT). It offers robust security through file and folder permissions, supports large file sizes and partitions, and features advanced capabilities such as file compression, encryption, disk quotas, and automatic error correction and recovery. These characteristics make NTFS ideal for environments where data security and reliability are paramount, such as in business and server systems, and on large-capacity drives.\n\nOn the other hand, FAT32 is an older file system that extends the capabilities of the earlier FAT16. FAT32’s simplicity and broad compatibility make it ideal for removable storage devices like USB flash drives and SD cards, and for legacy systems. It can be read and written by almost all operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and even gaming consoles. However, FAT32 has significant limitations: it cannot handle files larger than 4GB and partitions beyond 8TB, and it lacks the advanced security and reliability features of NTFS.\n\nIn terms of security, NTFS supports file-level permissions and encryption, making it suitable for sensitive data storage, while FAT32 does not offer these protections, making it less secure. NTFS also provides improved performance with its journaling feature, which logs changes before they are made, helping recover from crashes and maintaining file system integrity. FAT32’s simpler structure, in contrast, makes it easier to implement and manage for smaller storage tasks.\n\nIn summary, NTFS is preferred for modern, high-capacity storage where security and reliability are crucial. FAT32, with its universal compatibility and low overhead, remains useful for legacy systems and cross-platform data sharing, particularly with smaller, removable storage devices.",

    "question": "Discuss the various disk scheduling algorithms covered in the module, highlighting their advantages, disadvantages, and typical scenarios where they are used.",
    "answer": "Disk scheduling algorithms are essential in managing how read/write requests are serviced in a disk system to optimise performance and reduce latency. The module describes several key disk scheduling algorithms, each with distinct advantages and drawbacks.\n\n**First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)** processes requests in the order they arrive. It’s simple and fair, ensuring no starvation. However, it can result in high total seek times due to random movement of the disk head, making it inefficient for performance.\n\n**Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)** selects the request closest to the current head position, reducing seek times and improving throughput. It provides better response and waiting times compared to FCFS. However, SSTF can cause starvation for requests far from the current head location, leading to uneven service times.\n\n**SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)** moves the head in one direction, servicing all requests until it reaches the end, then reverses. It avoids starvation and has consistent response times. However, it might move the head to the disk’s end even if there are no requests, causing unnecessary travel.\n\n**LOOK** is a refinement of SCAN, where the head moves only as far as the last request before reversing direction, preventing unnecessary head movement and improving performance.\n\n**C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)** improves fairness by servicing requests in one direction only, moving back to the start without servicing on the return. It provides uniform wait times but can have more seek movements overall.\n\n**C-LOOK** combines the benefits of LOOK and C-SCAN by moving only as far as the last request in one direction before jumping back to the start, reducing unnecessary head travel.\n\nEach algorithm balances trade-offs between seek time, fairness, and response time. FCFS is simple but inefficient, SSTF is fast but can starve distant requests, while SCAN and LOOK variants are fairer and more consistent. C-SCAN and C-LOOK ensure uniform service at the cost of potentially more movement. The choice of algorithm depends on workload patterns and desired balance between performance and fairness in disk systems.",

    "question": "Describe the file allocation methods in an operating system, highlighting how each method manages disk space and the associated advantages and disadvantages.",
    "answer": "File allocation methods determine how files are stored and managed on a disk. The module covers three main allocation methods: contiguous, linked, and indexed.\n\n**Contiguous allocation** assigns a single continuous block of space to a file. This allows for fast sequential and direct access, as all blocks are adjacent. It’s straightforward to implement, with minimal metadata needed (starting block and length). However, it suffers from external fragmentation and makes it hard to expand file size beyond initial allocation, leading to wasted space and performance issues if files change frequently.\n\n**Linked allocation** uses pointers within each block to indicate the next block in the file. This allows files to grow dynamically and eliminates external fragmentation, as any free block can be allocated. It supports sequential access efficiently but has significant drawbacks: random access is slow since the system must traverse the list, and the overhead of storing pointers can reduce effective storage capacity. There is also no reverse traversal unless a doubly linked list is used.\n\n**Indexed allocation** overcomes the limitations of contiguous and linked methods by maintaining a separate index block containing pointers to each block of the file. This supports both sequential and direct access and removes external fragmentation. However, it introduces overhead because of the dedicated index block, and finding an appropriate size for the index block can be challenging—small blocks might waste space, and large index blocks might consume unnecessary disk space.\n\nEach method offers unique trade-offs. Contiguous allocation is excellent for static files that rarely change size. Linked allocation is good for dynamic data where size changes unpredictably. Indexed allocation provides flexibility and fast access but at the cost of additional overhead. Modern file systems often use hybrid or extent-based approaches, combining these methods to balance performance, reliability, and disk space efficiency based on the expected workload and file access patterns.",

    "question": "Explain the role of device management in an operating system, including the key tasks and types of devices it handles.",
    "answer": "Device management is a critical aspect of an operating system’s functionality. It ensures that hardware and virtual devices are used efficiently, securely, and reliably. The OS acts as an intermediary, providing a layer of abstraction and control over the devices connected to the system.\n\nThe main roles of device management include:\n- **Recognition**: Identifying newly connected devices by examining their hardware IDs and comparing them to known device databases.\n- **Configuration**: Setting up devices for use by allocating resources like memory, I/O ports, and loading necessary device drivers. Drivers serve as software interfaces translating OS commands into hardware-specific instructions.\n- **Control**: Managing the start, stop, and settings adjustments of devices, often through device control APIs that standardise how software interacts with hardware.\n- **Monitoring**: Keeping track of device status and usage, detecting errors, and ensuring optimal operation. The OS uses the I/O controller to oversee device interactions, maintaining an inventory of connected devices and their state.\n- **Security**: Implementing access controls and encryption to prevent unauthorised access or tampering with devices.\n- **Allocation and Deallocation**: Managing access to devices, deciding which process can use a device and when, and freeing up resources once they’re no longer needed.\n\nThe types of devices managed include:\n- **Boot devices** (like SSDs) that store OS and application data.\n- **Character devices** (keyboards, printers) that handle data streams without addressing individual bytes.\n- **Network devices** (NICs, routers) that facilitate data transmission across networks.\n\nEffective device management is crucial for multitasking, as it ensures that multiple processes can share devices without conflict or performance degradation. It also maintains security, stability, and efficient resource use in complex, multi-device environments. Ultimately, device management enables seamless interaction between software applications and the diverse hardware that powers modern computing.",

    "question": "Discuss the concept of file protection in operating systems, detailing the mechanisms and their importance in maintaining data security and integrity.",
    "answer": "File protection in operating systems is a crucial aspect of safeguarding data from unauthorised access, tampering, or loss. It involves implementing mechanisms to control who can access files and what operations they can perform, ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n**Key mechanisms of file protection include:**\n- **Access Control**: The OS uses permissions (read, write, execute, delete) to determine who can perform which operations on a file. These permissions can be assigned to individual users or groups, enforcing the principle of least privilege.\n- **Authentication**: Before accessing a file, users must verify their identity using mechanisms like passwords, biometric data, or security tokens. This ensures that only legitimate users can access sensitive data.\n- **Authorisation**: After authentication, the OS verifies what specific actions the authenticated user is allowed to perform on a file based on predefined policies.\n- **Encryption**: To protect data confidentiality, files can be encrypted. Encryption converts readable data into an unreadable format that only authorised users with the correct decryption keys can access.\n- **Audit Trails**: Systems maintain logs of file access and modifications, allowing administrators to track activities, detect security breaches, and hold users accountable for their actions.\n- **File Integrity Checks**: These mechanisms verify that files have not been altered without authorisation, using checksums or hash comparisons to detect tampering.\n\n**Importance:**\n- **Confidentiality**: Sensitive data is kept private, accessible only to authorised users.\n- **Integrity**: File protection ensures that data remains accurate and consistent, safeguarding against unauthorised changes.\n- **Availability**: Protection mechanisms also defend against data loss or destruction, ensuring files are available when needed.\n- **Compliance**: Many industries must adhere to regulatory standards for data protection (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). File protection ensures these obligations are met, reducing the risk of legal penalties.\n\nBy combining these mechanisms, file protection ensures a robust security framework, reducing vulnerabilities and maintaining the trustworthiness of the data stored in a computer system.",
