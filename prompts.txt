  "title": "Provide a clear, descriptive title here",
  "description": "This is the actual case study content, fully written and detailed.",
  "codeBlock": "```language\ncode snippet\n```",
  "language": "Mention the programming language if code is present, otherwise leave blank",
  "mcq": [
    {
      "question": "Write the MCQ question here",
      "codeBlock": "```language\ncode snippet\n```",
      "language": "Mention the programming language if code is present, otherwise leave blank",
